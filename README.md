In Progress

**Project Objective**
To determine the optimal capital allocation for a $10M loan portfolio to maximize return while minimizing risk, followed by predictive modeling to assess individual loan applicant risk.

**Methodology & Tools**
Prescriptive Analytics (Optimization): Using Python (PuLP) to solve a linear programming problem with constraints on total budget, risk exposure (max 20% high risk), and diversification.

Predictive Modeling: Building Random Forest and Neural Network models (Scikit-Learn) to predict default probabilities for new applicants.

Risk Forecasting: Implementing Monte Carlo simulations to estimate net profit distributions under varying default rate scenarios.

Ethical AI: Conducting a bias audit to ensure the model does not discriminate against protected demographic groups.

**Upcoming Deliverables**
[ ] Python Notebook with Optimization Model

[ ] Predictive Risk Classification Model

[ ] Executive Dashboard (Risk/Return Trade-off)
